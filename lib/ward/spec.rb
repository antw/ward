# The 'spec' directory contains various reuseable helpers for use with RSpec.
#
# The helpers are _not_ loaded when doing +require 'ward'+; if you wish to
# use these helpers -- perhaps for testing your own custom validations -- you
# must:
#
#   require 'ward'
#   require 'ward/spec'
#

require 'ward/spec/matcher_matcher'
